## React Router

React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering--so take your pick!

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

## React Bootstrap

React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@4.6.0
```
