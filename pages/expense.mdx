# Understanding the Expense Approval Workflow on Finnoto

## Introduction

Efficient management of expenses in an organisation requires a well-structured approval workflow.Finnoto offers a comprehensive Expense Approval Workflow
system that integrates both a dedicated Point of Contact (POC) approval stage and subsequent rule-based authorization levels. This article dives deeper into them
intricacies of the workflow, highlighting the significance of POC approval, the subsequent rule-driven approval process, and how to effectively navigate these
stages.

## The Crucial Role of POC Approval

Before an expense can proceed through the established approval rules, it must first pass through a dedicated Point of Contact (POC) approval. The
POC serves as the initial gatekeeper, ensuring the legitimacy, accuracy, and necessity of the expense. This crucial step adds an extra layer of scrutiny
to expenses, preventing unnecessary or inappropriate costs from entering the approval pipeline. POC approval acts as a foundational checkpoint,
setting the stage for the subsequent stages of approval.

## Integrating Rule-based Authorization

Following the POC approval, the expense enters the realm of rule-based authorization. At this juncture, the Expense Approval Workflow adheres to predefined
rules and conditions set by the organisation. These rules determine the subsequent approvers and the criteria that must be met for the expense to gain approval.
By automating this process, Finnoto eliminates manual intervention, reduces errors, and expedites decision-making.

## Navigating the Workflow

<Steps>
###  POC Approval (Level One - Verification)

The expense initiates its journey with POC approval, the first level of verification. The designated POC evaluates the expense's legitimacy and compliance with company policies.

### Transition to Rule-based Approval

After securing POC approval, the expense progresses to subsequent approval levels. The meticulous rule-based authorization process is triggered, aligning with the predetermined criteria and approval flow

### Approvers based on Set Rules

The authorization process identifies the next set of approvers based on the established rules. These rules could consider factors like individual,departmental head, managerial levels, user groups, or any other parameters specific to the organisation's structure.

### Efficient Decision-Making

Rule-based authorization expedites decision-making. Approvers are prompted based on their roles and responsibilities, reducing delays and enhancing the efficiency of the approval process.

### Approval Flow Monitoring

The Approval Workflow Tab available in the expense details page in Finnoto provides an at-a-glance overview of the entire approval process. Users can track the progress of each level and view details of completed stages.

### Transfer of Approval Flow

In case of a need to transfer the approval to another individual, the system facilitates a seamless transfer process, ensuring continuity and minimising disruptions.

## Stages of Approval

<Steps>

### Verification Stage

The journey begins here. After POC approval (if assigned), expenses enter the Verification stage. Once approved, the system transitions to
the next stage, considering the configured approval flows.When a POC rejects an expense, it is immediately cancelled, halting its progress within the workflow and
preventing them from advancing to subsequent stages

### FinOps Stage

The approved expenses from the Verification stage move to the FinOps stage. Just like the Verification stage, FinOps has its own approval flow.
Approvers here assess the financial implications, ensuring compliance with budgets and financial plans.

### Payment Stage

Once the FinOps stage is navigated successfully, expenses proceed to the Payment stage. This is the final approval stage. Similar to the
In previous stages, Payment has its own approval configuration

  When all required approvals within a stage are secured, the expense progresses
  to the next stage. The specific stage turns green, highlighting its successful
  progression.

## Changing States of Expense and Significance

### Open State

    When an expense is unassigned or lacks a Point of Contact (POC), it's in the Open state, awaiting assignment

### Submitted State

After a POC is assigned, submitting an expense signifies the initiation of the approval process. The Submitted state indicates the expense is in the workflow.

### Pending Approval State

As the expense progresses through each stage, it awaits approval. Whether in Verification, FinOps, or Payment, the Pending Approval state indicates that decisions are pending from the assigned approvers

### On-Hold State

At any stage, if an approver, including the POC, places the expense on hold, the On-Hold state is activated. This indicates a temporary pause due to specific reasons

### Approved State

As all stages' approvals are obtained, the expense's Approved state reflects its readiness for processing. This state marks the end of the approval journey

### Rejected State

If any level of any stage's approval is rejected, the expense is deemed unsuitable for processing. The Rejected state indicates that it cannot advance to subsequent stages.

## Recalling an Expense

<Callout>

Recalling an expense is possible, but only before a payment is recorded. This feature empowers creators to review, amend, or reevaluate expenses, ensuring accuracy and compliance before financial transactions are executed.

Once an expense is recalled it will also be considered as `Rejected` on the system

## Importance of Approval Workflow

The Approval Workflow system holds several crucial advantages for businesses

### Control and Compliance

By defining rules and criteria for approvals, organisations can enforce compliance with financial policies and regulations. This prevents unauthorised or non-compliant expenses from being processed

### Budget Management

Approval Workflows provide a mechanism to monitor and manage expenses against predefined budgets. This helps in controlling overspending and aligning expenditures with financial plans

### Transparency

The workflow's visibility into approval stages ensures transparency in the process. Employees can track the status of their expense approvals, reducing confusion and delays.

### Reduced Errors

Automation of approval processes reduces the chances of human errors that could occur in manual approval methods

### Efficiency

Workflow automation accelerates the approval process, eliminating bottlenecks and reducing the time taken for decisions
